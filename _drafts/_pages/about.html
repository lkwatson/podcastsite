  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I've spent a career getting into people's heads, as a writer, a strategist, and a natural empathisizer to, well, basically everyone and everything. If I can say I've gained one thing it's that I've met a lot of really smart, clever, ingenious women who've accomplished a lot in their careers, but usually it's through a story that's even more interesting, inspiring and compelling.&nbsp; These are the women I know you'll want to meet.&nbsp; The women who, with humor, grace and a great deal of knowing see the world and work in the world creating profound change, big and small.&nbsp; These are the women you wanna know. Really.&nbsp; Just listen.<br></p>
