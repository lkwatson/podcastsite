Pam Pleasants comes from 3 generations of thinkers and educators. Though born and raised in the segregated South, Pam went on to earn her PhD at Harvard School of Education, with two of the seminal figures in the women's movement. Together they focused on helping adolescent girls find their voices, a focus present as Pam goes about her work in Admissions at Milton Academy.  Extraordinarily funny and gracious, her presence is one to be reckoned with. You can't help but enjoy yourself when you're with her. I promise you you will.
