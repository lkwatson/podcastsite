Gwen Foreman is the kind of fun, interesting, honest woman that would make it as fun to work with as it would be to share a cocktail. While she would never admit it, she's ridiculously bright - as witnessed by what her company, Cumberland Farms, has accomplished since her arrival as Vice President of Marketing.

Take a minute and listen as Gwen and I talk work, life and why a blank twitter feed will not mean the end to your career.
