    <title>Smart Women I Know</title>
    <description>I've spent a career getting into people's heads, as a writer, a strategist, and a natural empathisizer to, well, basically everyone and everything. If I can say I've gained one thing it's that I've met a lot of really smart, clever, ingenious women who've accomplished a lot in their careers, but usually it's through a story that's even more interesting, inspiring and compelling.  These are the women I know you'll want to meet.  The women who, with humor, grace and a great deal of knowing see the world and work in the world creating profound change, big and small.  These are the women you wanna know. Really.  Just listen.</description>
